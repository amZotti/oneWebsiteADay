<h1>Calculator Description</h1>
<p>As implied by the name, this website features a calculator with a basic CSS
design and complete calculator functionality</p>

<h2>Calculator Intent</h2>
<p>The calculator functionality was created using CoffeeScript. I have
wanted to include CoffeeScript in one my websites for a while now in an effort
to increase my breadth of skill. I decided to create a calculator because it
would allow me to really flex my CoffeeScript skills since calculator
functionality requires a good bit of logic, relative to me previous websites
anyway. so I
decided to create a calculator that was responsible for parsing user input and
providing the correct calculations based on that user input.</p>
