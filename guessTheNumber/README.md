<h1>Guess a Number Description</h1>
<p>A number is randomly generated and the user needs to guess what it is. As the
user guesses closer or farther away the background color changes. </p>

<h2>Guess a Number intent</h2>
<p>I want to start expanding and using a vareity of libraries. This small
website gave me a taste of using jQuery's UI color library. This represents a
shift in my focus from concentrating on depth of design to instead begin
concentrating on breadth of design.</p>
