<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Pixtr is a photo sharing app which allows users to login, create friends, create
galleries, upload pictures, search pictures, and 'like' pictures.</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>I originally created Pixtr in the summer of 2014 when I first was learning
Rails. <a href="https://github.com/amZotti/pixtr">Pixtr was the very first Rails
app I made.</a>
I recently decided to go back and add design to Pixtr as part of my <a
href="https://github.com/amZotti/oneWebsiteADay">30 websites 30 days
challenge</a> in an effort to develop my design skills. I have not changed any
of the core functionality because I want to preserve the quality of work I did
when I first started, in order to track my progress since then.</p>
