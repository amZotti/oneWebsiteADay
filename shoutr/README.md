<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Shoutr is a social network which allows users to login, follow friends, create
shouts which appear on friends dashboards, upload pictures, and search for
users.</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>I originally created Shoutr in the summer of 2014 when I first was learning
Rails. <a href="https://github.com/amZotti/shoutr">Shotr was one of the very first Rails
app I ever made.</a>
I recently decided to go back and add design to Shoutr as part of my <a
href="https://github.com/amZotti/oneWebsiteADay">30 websites 30 days
challenge</a> in an effort to develop my design skills. I have not changed any
of the core functionality because I want to preserve the quality of work I did
when I first started, in order to track my progress since then.</p>
