<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Greetr is a basic Rails app that allows users to create accounts and send
messages to each other.</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>I originally created Greetr in the summer of 2014 when I first was learning
Rails. <a href="https://github.com/amZotti/greetr">Greetr was one of the very first Rails
app I ever made.</a>
I recently decided to go back and launch Shoutr on Heroku as part of my <a
href="https://github.com/amZotti/oneWebsiteADay">30 websites 30 days
challenge</a>. I have not changed any
of the core functionality because I want to preserve the quality of work I did
when I first started, in order to track my progress since then.</p>
