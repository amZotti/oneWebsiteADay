<h1>Outcome</h1>
Significantly increase my front end design and development skills.

<h1>Purpose</h1>
I made really cool apps in the past but despite the fact they had awesome
functionality, they were lacking in design. As a result they never reached their
full potential. I want to be able to create apps not
only with outstanding functionality, but also with eye catching
design.
