<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Backbone Scratchpad is a single page application (SAP) which uses
Backbone.js. It Is my first Backbone App and it includes all 4 CRUD operations.
All applications data is bootstrapped on page load which makes my backend Rails
server become nothing more than an API used for data synchronization.
