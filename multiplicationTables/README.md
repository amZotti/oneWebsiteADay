<h1>Multiplication Tables Description</h1>
<p>A user inputs a number and the result of that number is multiplied by the
numbers 1-12 and then displayed in real time.</p>

<h2>Multipliation Tables Intent</h2>
<p>I want to start expanding and using a vareity of libraries. This small
website gave me a good usage to try out what I learned from reading AngularJS
docs. This represents a shift in my focus from concentrating on depth of design to instead begin
concentrating on breadth of design.</p>
